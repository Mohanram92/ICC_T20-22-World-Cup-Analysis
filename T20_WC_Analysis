DAX Formulas 

Measures:				
Sno	Measures	Description / Purpose	DAX FORMULA	TABLE
1	Total Runs	Total number of runs scored by the batsman	Total Runs = SUM(fact_batting_summary[runs])	fact_batting_summary
2	Total Innings Batted	Total number of innings a batsman got a chance to bat	Total Innings Batted = COUNT(fact_batting_summary[match_id])	fact_batting_summary
3	Total Innings Dismissed	To find the number of innings batsman got out	SUM(fact_batting_summary[out])	fact_batting_summary
4	Batting Average	Average runs scored in an innings	Batting Avg = DIVIDE([Total Runs],[Total Innings Dismissed],0)	fact_batting_summary
				
5	Total balls Faced	Total number of balls faced by the batsman	total balls faced = SUM(fact_batting_summary[balls])	fact_batting_summary
6	Strike Rate	No of runs scored per 100 balls 	Strike rate = DIVIDE([Total Runs],[total balls faced],0)*100	fact_batting_summary
				
7	Batting Position	Batting position of a player	Batting Position = ROUNDUP(AVERAGE(fact_batting_summary[batting_pos]),0)	fact_batting_summary
8	Boundary %	Percentage of boundaries scored by the Batsman	Boundary % =  DIVIDE(SUM(fact_batting_summary[Boundary runs]),[Total Runs],0)	fact_batting_summary
9	Avg. balls Faced	Average balls faced by the batter in an innings	AVERAGE(fact_batting_summary[balls])	fact_batting_summary

11	balls Bowled	Total number of balls bowled by the bowler	balls Bowled = SUM(fact_bowling_summary[balls])	fact_bowling_summary
12	Runs Conceded	Total runs conceded by the bowler	Runs Conceded = SUM(fact_bowling_summary[runs])	fact_bowling_summary
13	Bowling Economy	Average number of runs conceded in an over	Economy = DIVIDE( [Runs Conceded], ([balls Bowled]/6),0)	fact_bowling_summary
14	Bowling Strike Rate	Number of balls bowled per wicket	Bowling Strike Rate = DIVIDE([balls Bowled], [wickets],0)	fact_bowling_summary
